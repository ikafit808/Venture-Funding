## Background

You work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a fictitious venture capital firm. The Alphabet Soup business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will become successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The team has given you a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. This file contains various types of information about the organizations, including whether they ultimately became successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become successful.

## What You're Creating

To predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, you will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

This challenge consists of three technical deliverables. You will do the following:

Preprocess data for a neural network model.

Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

Optimize the model.

## Libraries Used

1. Pandas
2. pathlib
3. tensorflow
4. sklearn


## Summary/Outcome

### Orignial Model
Loss 55.5%
Accuracy 73.04%

### Alternative Model 1
Loss 65.87%
Accuracy 52.92%

### Alternative Model 2
Loss 57.71%
Accuracy 73.08%

It seems as though the original model and the alternative model 2 were very similar in outcomes. However, alternative model 1 did slightly worse then the other two.
